# Real Word Assosor

A tool to coordinate and incentivise a set of independent actors to assess a set of independent criteria, using Chainlink and XMPP to link block chain payment rails to real world activity. 
Actors are assigned randomly to various criterion, with each criterion having at least three actors assessing it.
The system rewards actors who's assessment aligns with that of the majority, and penalises assessments that go against. 
Once an assessor has registered on chain, all other interaction between the assessor and the system is done via XMPP (Instant messaging), using Chainlink to bring the results back on chain to automatically execute payment.
